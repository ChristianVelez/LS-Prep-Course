What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'  

The error refers to a missing closing bracket.  Ruby was expecting 
a closing bracket and instead got a closing parentheses so the program
broke and gave us this error.
